### Installation

*Prerequistes*: You must have llama-stack installed and configured with at least one inference engine. An example of doing
this with OpenAI as the inference engine is in `examples/manifests/llama-stack/base`.

Install the extension into the Argo CD instance by adding the following in the appropriate spots, note here we are using
the Argo CD Operator but feel free to adapt it for the `argcd-cm` ConfigMap if you have deployed Argo CD using the Helm chart:

```
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1beta1
kind: ArgoCD

  namespace: openshift-gitops

    # This is needed to allow the extension to communicate with the proxy-extension
    # defined in extraConfig. Note the name `assistant` must match the proxy-extension
    # name.
    p, role:readonly, extensions, invoke, assistant, allow
  # Configuration items that are placed in
  extraConfig:
    # Define the extension end point

        # needs to be installed in the server component otherwise the
        # Argo CD Proxy Extension will fail.
